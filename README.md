Absolutely! Here’s a **detailed `README.md`** for your fully integrated C++ Docker/DevOps dashboard project, covering setup, usage, features, and development notes.

# Sharpishly Dev Dashboard

A **C++ MVC application** for managing Docker-based development environments, certificates, and DevOps tasks across multiple environments (local, development, staging, production). Includes a **web dashboard** for real-time control and deployment.

---

## Features

### Dashboard
- Web-based interface at `http://localhost:8080`
- Monitors and manages multiple environments
- One-click **deploy** for each environment with real-time logs
- **Add, update, remove environments** from the dashboard
- Execute common DevOps tasks:
  - Generate self-signed SSL certificates
  - Cleanup Docker containers, images, volumes, networks
  - Update git repository
  - Update `/etc/hosts` entries
  - Check Docker status

### Environment Management
- Supports multiple environments with individual Docker Compose files
- Port checks to prevent conflicts
- Branch management for each environment
- Automatic Git pull before deployment
- Logs streamed to dashboard

### MVC Structure
- **Model**: Manages environment data and system operations  
- **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and invokes model functions  
- **View**: Web dashboard (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`)

## Prerequisites

- **C++17 compiler** (tested with GCC 13+)
- **CMake** (>= 3.10)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Git**
- **Linux/macOS** (for system commands and port checks)
- Optional: `lsof` for port checking

---

## Setup

1. **Clone or create the project folder**:

```bash
mkdir PREDEV && cd PREDEV
````

2. **Generate all project files**:

```bash
chmod +x generate_all.sh
./generate_all.sh
```

This will generate:

* Full MVC structure
* Dashboard (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
* EnvironmentManager with add/update/remove/deploy

3. **Build and run the server**:

```bash
./run.sh
```

Server will start at: `http://localhost:8080`

---

## Usage

### Dashboard

* Open `http://localhost:8080`
* **DevOps buttons**:

  * Generate SSL certificate
  * Cleanup Docker
  * Update Git repo
  * Check Docker status
  * Update `/etc/hosts`
* **Environment section**:

  * **List environments** with current branch, Docker Compose file, ports
  * **Deploy environment**: streams logs in real-time
  * **Add/Update environment**: enter details in the form
  * **Remove environment**: click `Remove` next to the environment

---

### Environment Deployment Workflow

1. Click **Deploy** → server checks:

   * Web port availability
   * API port availability
2. Switches to the environment’s branch
3. Pulls latest Git changes
4. Stops Docker containers, rebuilds, and starts them
5. Streams logs back to dashboard

---

## Development Notes

* **Add new features** by creating new Models/Controllers and integrating into `AppController.cpp`
* **View updates**: modify `www/index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`
* **Docker Compose**: each environment can have its own compose file
* **Real-time logs**: uses HTTP streaming to `<pre>` element in dashboard

---

## Security Notes

* Currently runs as the user who started the server.
* Commands like `sudo systemctl stop nginx` require user permissions.
* Use caution when deploying in production.

---

## License

This project is **MIT licensed**.

---

## Future Enhancements

* Inline editing for environment updates
* Role-based access control for dashboard
* Notifications when ports are in use or deployment fails
* Integration with CI/CD pipelines

```

---

I can also create a **`README.md` with embedded screenshots and sample dashboard view** if you want it to be **even more visually descriptive for new developers**.  

Do you want me to do that next?
